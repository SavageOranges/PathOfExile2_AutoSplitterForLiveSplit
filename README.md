# Path of Exile 2 AutoSplitter for LiveSplit

## Installation

## Upcoming Features 

- Boss Dialogue split case for more accurate split times (Cemetery of the Eternals)
- Boss Rush setting for All and Mandatory Only bosses.
- Non-linear splitting to allow out-of-order progression.
- Test / implement compatibility with this save and quit component: https://github.com/Shotnex4/LiveSplit.TimeAttackPause

## Known Issues
- Cemetery of the Eternals split is inaccurate due to requirement to revisit multiple times and kill Lachlann. Needs 'Boss Dialogue' split event to get a more accurate split (split from The Grim Tangle on enter, add separate event for killing Lachlann). 
- Not sure how the two instances of The Halani Gates will behaves in Act 2.
